# Web Tools

This Atom Package simplifies some of the processing of hand-coding HTML.

The various tools either replace selected text with HTML code which would be more tedious to type or, in some cases, inserts snippets of HTML.

There are also some additional tools to help with setting up pages and some common preferences.

See [HOWTO](HOWTO.md) for documentation on how to use the tools
